            <h2><i>Project 1</i></h2>
            <p><b>Surgarcane Bio-Bottles</b></p>
            <p>The main motive of this project is to replace plastic bottles from the market and provding eco-friendly decomposible bottles.
               Here ,making bio-bottles from sugarcane badges (raw material) and adding plant seeds in between the layer that produce a plant after some days of decomposition of bottle. 
               These bottles are cheap, eco-friendly, portable, hygenic and decomposible .
            </p>

            <h2><i>Project 2</i></h2>
            <p><b>Safety Transportation for Indian Army</b></p>
            <P>we are solving these uncertainty's at the road network by a set of discrete scenarios 
              the method is introduced to find exact and intact roots from the origin to the destination for each vehicles .</p>
              <p>
                Technology Stack : - In hardware part... Here we are using ultrasonic sensor for the detection of any obstacle 
                 within a distance range of a few tens of meter.</p>
               <p> In Software Part  .. Here using Arduino Uno  ,it is  cheapest and flexible programmable microcontroller board  that can be 
                integrated into a variety of electronic projects with coding and make our  our circuit more access</P>

            <h2><i>Project 3</i></h2>
             <p><b>Avlanches</b></p>
             <p> A Software that serves as the foundation for identifying the patterns and anomalies that may indicate the presence of buried victims.
             This approach involves the systematic collection of data from diverse sources.</p>
        
            <h2><i>Project 4</i></h2>
            <p><b>Crime Detection using AI</b></p>
            <p>we are solving these uncertainty's at the road network by a set of discrete scenarios 
            the method is introduced to find exact and intact roots from the origin to the destination for each vehicles .</p>
